# Task-workflow-tracker

This project is designed to help organizations track tasks, monitor their status, and identify delays efficiently. It demonstrates both **system building** and **data analysis** skills using Python.

## Features

### 1. Task Tracking System (CSV-based)
- Add new tasks with **task name**, **priority**, and **status**.
- View all tasks stored in a CSV file.
- Handles basic CRUD operations in a simple workflow system.

### 2. Task Analysis (Pandas-based)
- Tracks the **status count** (Completed, In Progress, Pending).
- Analyzes **employee workload** by counting tasks assigned to each employee.
- Identifies **delayed tasks** based on days taken for completion.
- Generates simple **visualizations** using bar charts for better understanding.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- CSV module (for task storage)

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook(s) in **Google Colab** or any Python IDE.
2. Run each cell step by step:
    - For the CSV system: `task_tracker_demo.ipynb`
    - For the analysis/dashboard: `Task_Workflow_Tracker.ipynb`
3. Explore tasks, status counts, employee workload, and delays.

## Outcome
- Helps track and manage tasks efficiently.
- Provides insights into employee workload and delayed tasks.
- Demonstrates a progression from a basic system to data-driven analysis.
